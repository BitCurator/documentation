Search for images recursively from the present directory
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the Nautilus file browser.
2. Navigate to the top of the directory tree you would like to search. (Example: to search for all images in a users home directory, navigate to /home/[username])
3. Right click anywhere within Nautilus and select Scripts > Find Files > Find Images (recursively).
4. Nautilus will open a new window and create a temp directory with symlinks to all of the images found in the directory/directories you searched.
5. Click 'No' when asked if you would like to delete the new temp directory (see Figure 9).  
  
**Figure 9**: Click 'No' when asked if you would like to delete the temp directory.
