# documentation

This site uses mkdocs.

New pages may be added by creating new markdown files in the appropriate folder.

New folders may be added by creating a folder (e.g. `new_folder`) and an accompanying Markdown page suffixed with `-index` (e.g. `new_folder-index.md`)
Pages in subfolders will be grouped alongside the rest of the folder content.
