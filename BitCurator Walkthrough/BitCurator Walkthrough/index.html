                <h1 id="bitcurator-walkthrough">BitCurator Walkthrough</h1>
<p>In previous releases, tools to support a variety of workflows were organized into folders on the desktop. In BitCurator 5.x, these tools are organized in submenus under the Applications menu in the top left (to the right of the Activities menu). The submenus include Imaging and Recovery, Forensics and Reporting, Package and Export, and Additional Tools.</p>
<h1 id="imaging-and-recovery">Imaging and Recovery</h1>
<p><strong>BitCurator supports multiple acquisition scenarios: attaching physical media to inspect and analyze digital materials, creating forensic disk images, or transferring files into the environment.</strong></p>
<p>The Imaging and Recovery submenu lists tools to assist in device imaging and recovery. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Brasero">Brasero</a></strong>: A GNOME application to burn CDs and DVDs, and create 1:1 copies of CDs and DVDs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/">cdrdao</a></strong>: An application to record audio or data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based on a textual description of the CD contents ( <a href="https://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/example.html#toc-file-example">toc-file</a> )</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/dcfldd">dcfldd</a></strong>: An enhanced version of GNU dd with features useful for forensics and security, including hashing on-the-fly and split outputs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/">ddrescue</a></strong>: A data recovery tool with advanced features to assist in rescue of good data from devices with read errors.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/johnkw/dumpfloppy">dumpfloppy</a></strong>: A tool to read floppy disks in arbitrary formats supported by the PC floppy controller, and work with the resulting image files.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ewfacquire">ewfacquire</a></strong>: A utility to acquire media data from a source and store it in EWF format (Expert Witness Compression Format).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://guymager.sourceforge.io/">Guymager</a></strong>: A GUI tool to create raw and EWF-packaged images from devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="safely-mount-devices">Safely Mount Devices</h3>
<p>If you have devices (e.g. USB drives, CD-ROMs) that you'd like to image or explore with BitCurator, you can connect them so that BitCurator can see them, but safely: no worries about writing any data back to the device. For example, last modified dates assigned by the target media's file system won't be overwritten with the current date.</p>
<p>The <strong>mount policy</strong> provides write-blocked access to removable media. <strong>Mounting</strong> is a technical term for registering a storage device with the host system so it can be browsed or used, and you will need to mount any external device attached to the BitCurator system, whether that occurs automatically or by invoking the safe mount script. Images of devices, (e.g. forensic images of floppies, CDs or drives) need to be mounted as well for most uses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/documentation/All Step-by-Step Guides/Imaging and Recovery Guides/Set Mount Policy">Set Mount Policy</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-disk-images">Create Disk Images</h3>
<p>BitCurator uses open source disk imaging tools, such as <a href="/documentation/All Step-by-Step Guides/Imaging and Recovery Guides/Imaging with Guymager">Guymager</a> and dcfldd, to capture bit-identical images from magnetic, optical, solid-state, and hybrid media. Disk images can be captured in various formats, including raw (just the bitstream), E01 (Expert Witness Format, which we support using the open source libewf library, and AFF (Advanced Forensic Format).</p>
<p>Capturing disk images in forensic formats such as E01 and AFF provides many advantages. The images can be stored compressed or uncompressed, can be split into multiple storage containers, can be parsed at the file system level without explicitly extracting the raw image, and can be embedded with provenance and capture metadata. <strong>Forensic images ensure that no inadvertent changes are made during pre-ingest chain-of-custody</strong>, and provide a consistent baseline for generating different types of access materials.</p>
<p>In the BitCurator Environment, forensically-packaged disk images can be mounted by right-clicking on them and selecting "Mount Disk Image". This allows you to browse the source in a safe, read-only environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Image with <strong>Guymager:</strong> Create a perfect capture of your device's file structure and all contents (including hidden files and fragments) PLUS package this image with information about the disk imaging process. When anyone accesses the disk image later on, they'll have information about who imaged the device, when the device was imaged, etc. as well as be able to explore the exact state of the device as it was when you imaged it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="/documentation/All Step-by-Step Guides/Imaging and Recovery Guides/Imaging with Guymager">Imaging with Guymager</a> (Step-by-Step Guide)</strong></li>
<li>Image with <strong>dcfldd:</strong> This command line program is an enhance version of the <strong>dd</strong> program. If you are having trouble with Guymager, or if you are comfortable with command line use, <strong>dcfldd</strong> can be very useful and scriptable.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="forensics-and-reporting">Forensics and Reporting</h1>
<p><strong>BitCurator includes multiple software tools that assist users with identifying and prioritizing important information in raw and forensically packaged disk images. This includes files format identification, location of deleted files and files fragments, cryptographic hashing, and reporting on potentially private and personally identifying information.</strong></p>
<p>The Forensics and Reporting submenu lists forensics and forensics-adjacent tools. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BitCurator Mounter</strong>: A lightweight GUI tool to assist with mounting and unmounting devices.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/tw4l/brunnhilde">Brunnhilde</a></strong>: A tool to generate aggregate reports of files in a directory or disk image based on input from Richard Lehane's <a href="http://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried">Siegfried</a>.

</ul>
<p>BitCurator generates technical metadata in the form of Digital Forensics XML (DFXML). DFXML has been developed around a set of digital forensics tools that can both consume and produce a common set of tags. BitCurator also generates PREMIS metadata for each data forensics tool that is applied to a disk image, providing an accurate record of provenance for each stage of processing.</p>
<h3 id="extract-metadata-from-disk-images-and-files">Extract metadata from disk images and files</h3>
<p>BitCurator incorporates file system analytics and stream-based forensics technologies to identify and assist with redaction of potentially private and sensitive information (including personally identifiable information). In particular, BitCurator incorporates <a href="/documentation/All Step-by-Step Guides/Forensics and Reporting Guides/Scanning Disk Images, Files, and Directories with bulk_extractor">fiwalk</a>, a tool originally developed by Simson Garfinkel to export an XML file detailing file system hierarchy within a disk image, including files and folders, deleted materials, and information in slack space.</p>
<p>Please see the following <strong>Step-by-Step Guides</strong>: </p>

<h3 id="forensics-and-reporting-nautilus-scripts">Forensics and Reporting Nautilus Scripts</h3>
<p>Nautilus is a popular GUI file manager for Linux and it functions similarly to Windows Explorer on Windows systems and Finder on Macs. One key feature of Nautilus is the ability to add custom functionality by incorporating user-created back-end scripts. These scripts work much like plug-ins for a web browser and extend Nautilus's basic functionality. A number of custom Nautilus scripts are included in the BitCurator Environment specifically geared to assist the digital archivist in pre-ingest data analysis. </p>
