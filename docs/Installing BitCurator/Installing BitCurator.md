## Getting Started
Use the links to the relevant sections below to begin installing BitCurator on a fresh host, or import a prebuilt Virtual Appliance. If you wish to see a list of the most recent releases (along with release notes), you can also visit [https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro/wiki/Releases](https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro/wiki/Releases).

There are two options for installing the BitCurator Environment:
 
 * [Installation Option 1: Deploy on a Clean Ubuntu Host](/documentation/BitCurator Environment/Installing BitCurator/Install Option 1: Installation via Dedicated Machine). (_This is the preferred method for running the BitCurator Environment._)
 * [Installation Option 2: Installation via Virtual Machine](/documentation/BitCurator Environment/Installing BitCurator/Install Option 2: Installation via Virtual Machine)

_Note: An internet connection is required during all stages of the installation._

_Note: BitCurator must be deployed on an x86/amd64 version of Ubuntu. Currently, it is not possible to use the Virtual Appliance or deploy it on systems with ARM processors (including Apple M1)._


### Quick Start Guide
The [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/BitCurator/bitcurator-distro/wiki/Releases#quickstart-guide) provides in instructions on installation and an initial walkthrough of the BitCurator Environment. Recommended if you have not used BitCurator before!

### Language Support and Ubuntu
The BitCurator Environment is built using Ubuntu, which has extensive support for a wide range of languages. However, language support packs are large. To keep the installation ISO and virtual environment small, we distribute BitCurator with only the English (US) language pack installed. Installing additional language packs is easy using the following steps. First, open the Ubuntu System Settings window by clicking on "System Settings" in the top right-hand icon in the menu bar at the top.
