Data Triage (Nautilus)
======================





Nautilus (see Figure 1) is a popular GUI file manager for Linux and is the default file manager in Ubuntu Linux 12.04. It functions similarly to *Windows Explorer* on Windows systems and *Finder* on Macs. One key feature of Nautilus is the ability to add custom functionality by incorporating user-created [back-end scripts](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NautilusScriptsHowto). These scripts work much like plug-ins for a web browser and extend Nautilus's basic functionality. We have included a number of custom Nautilus scripts in the BitCurator Environment specifically geared to assist the digital archivist in pre-ingest data analysis. See below for specific instruction on how to use Nautilus to perform a number of critical data analysis tasks.
