Set Mount Policy
====================

### Overview

BitCurator includes a convenience application indicator (small disk icon in the top right of the menu bar) that may be used to quickly set the current mount policy for USB Devices.

**When the disk icon is red, the mount policy is set writeable.** USB storage devices plugged into the system when this state is set can be read from, and written to.

**When the disk icon is green, the mount policy is set read-only.** USB storage devices plugged into the system when this state is set cannot be written to.

**Important notes:** Changing the mount policy state does not change the mount policy for devices currently plugged into your machine.
