Forensics and Reporting Guides
==============================

Guides for file format identification, location of deleted files and files fragments, cryptographic hashing, and reporting on potentially private and personally identifying information.

### Tools

The Forensics and Reporting submenu lists forensics and forensics-adjacent tools. These include:

* **BitCurator Mounter**: A lightweight GUI tool to assist with mounting and unmounting devices.
* **[Brunnhilde](https://github.com/tw4l/brunnhilde)**: A tool to generate aggregate reports of files in a directory or disk image based on input from Richard Lehane's [Siegfried](http://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried). Can optionally analyze content using bulk_extractor.
* **[bulk_extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor)**: A tool to scan disk images and directories for PII and other features.
* **[Bulk Reviewer](https://github.com/bulk-reviewer/bulk-reviewer)**: A tool to scan disk images and assist in the review of bulk_extractor reports.
* **[Deark](https://entropymine.com/deark/)**: A utility for file format and metadata analysis, data extraction, decompression, and image format decoding.
* **[DiskType](https://disktype.sourceforge.net/)**: A tool to detect the content format of a disk or disk image. It knows about common file systems, partition tables, and boot codes.
* **[fiwalk](https://forensics.wiki/fiwalk/)**: A program that processes a disk image using the SleuthKit library and outputs its results in Digital Forensics XML, the Attribute Relationship File Format (ARFF) format used by the Weka Datamining Toolkit, or an easy-to-read textual format.
* **identify-filenames**: A postprocessing script for bulk_extractor that reads report files and produces annotated versions with the file that contains each feature (when present) identified.
* **[md5deep](https://forensics.wiki/md5deep/)**: a set of programs to compute MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and other digests.
* **[nsrllookup](https://rjhansen.github.io/nsrllookup/)**: Query NSRLâ€™s MD5 hashes of known pieces of software.
* **[PhotoRec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/photoRec)**: File data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from media.
* **[RegRipper](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0)**: Extract the contents of Windows registry backups.
* **[Siegfried](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried)**: Signature-based file format identification.
* **[SSDeep](https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html)**: Fuzzy hashing tool.
* **[TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk)**: Data recovery software, companion to PhotoRec.
