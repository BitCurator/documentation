Package files and metadata with Bagger
======================================





Bagger is no longer included in the BitCurator Environment. It can still be installed in the environment - see the [project website](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger) for more details.

  


**Overview:**

The [Bagger software](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger) from the Library of Congress, provides a GUI application for creating and working with packages that conform to the [BagIt specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-17).  This application can be installed on BitCurator following instructions on the [project's page](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger).  







Step By Step:
-------------

**Step 1:** To begin creating a bag, click to 'Create a new bag' and select an existing profile to start with a set of predefined metadata fields or start with no profile to define your own.

**Step 4**:  Click the 'Save Bag As' link, providing a name and location for the bag.  Select the algorithm used for generating hashes that will be used for fixity checking, and click ok.  You will receive an on-screen notification that the bag has been successfully created.
